An advanced tag manager that seamlessly integrates into WordPress.

== Description ==

WP Tag Manager aims to seamlessly integrate into your WordPress admin. It looks and feels like the rest of the admin. Install it and see what I mean.

Features:

* Delete tags
* Edit tags
* Merge tags

Planned Features:

* Tag splitting
* Show untagged posts
* Show similar tags

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin.
2. Upload tag-manager.php to the plugins folder of your blog.
3. Goto the Plugins section of the WordPress admin and activate the plugin.
4. Goto the Tag tab of the Manage section and start managing your tags.

== Screenshots ==

1. A look at the tag list. It looks a lot like the category view doesn't it? It paginates if there are more than 15 tags.
2. Editing a tag is simple.
